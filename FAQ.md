## General Questions

### What is If/Then/Reset?

If/Then/Reset is a mental wellness app that helps you manage difficult emotions using a structured three-step process:
- **IF**: Identify what you're feeling
- **THEN**: Breathe and prepare to reset
- **RESET**: Use a physical technique to reset your nervous system

Think of it as "debugging your mind" - just like fixing code, we identify the issue, apply the fix, and reboot the system.

### Who is this app for?

If/Then/Reset is for anyone experiencing:
- Anxiety or stress
- Overwhelming emotions
- Panic or nervousness
- Sadness or depression
- Need for emotional regulation tools

The app is designed for ages 12+ and suitable for anyone seeking self-help wellness tools.

### Is this a medical app?

**No.** If/Then/Reset is a wellness and self-help tool, NOT:
- A medical device or treatment
- A substitute for therapy or counseling
- A diagnostic tool
- A crisis intervention service

Always consult qualified healthcare providers for medical advice and treatment.

## Getting Started

### How do I start my first reset?

1. Tap "Start Reset" on the home screen
2. **IF**: Select how you're feeling (anxious, stressed, etc.)
3. Rate intensity from 1-10
4. **THEN**: Follow the breathing exercise (optional: play a sound)
5. **RESET**: Choose a physical technique (pinch, snap, tap, etc.)
6. Follow the instructions
7. Add optional notes
8. View your completion affirmation

### What are the reset techniques?

The app offers 8 physical reset techniques:
1. **Pinch Myself**: Gently pinch your arm
2. **Snap Fingers**: Snap three times
3. **Tap Three Times**: Tap your temple
4. **Clap Hands**: Clap firmly
5. **Stretch Arms**: Stretch wide and breathe
6. **Splash Water**: Splash cold water on face
7. **Squeeze Hands**: Make fists, then release
8. **Stomp Feet**: Stomp firmly on ground

These techniques help "interrupt" anxious thought patterns and ground you in the present moment.

### Do I need to do all three steps?

Yes, for best results:
- **IF** helps you identify and acknowledge your feelings
- **THEN** prepares your nervous system with breathing
- **RESET** provides a physical "circuit breaker" for anxiety

The complete flow takes 2-5 minutes.

### Can I skip the breathing exercise?

Yes, the breathing exercise is optional. However, we recommend it because:
- Slows your heart rate
- Activates your parasympathetic nervous system
- Prepares you for the reset technique
- Enhances the effectiveness of the reset
