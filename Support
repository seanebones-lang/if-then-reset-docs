## Features Guide

### 8 Feeling Types

Each feeling type includes:
- A unique icon for quick visual recognition
- Color coding for easy identification
- Intensity tracking from 1-10

**When to use each:**
- **Anxious** - General anxiety, unease, nervousness about future events
- **Depressed** - Sadness, low mood, lack of motivation
- **Nervous** - Specific nervousness before events or situations
- **Overwhelmed** - Too much to handle, feeling buried
- **Stressed** - Pressure from responsibilities, deadlines, or demands
- **Panicked** - Acute anxiety, panic attack symptoms
- **Sad** - General sadness, grief, emotional pain
- **Worried** - Specific concerns or fears about outcomes

### 8 Reset Techniques

Each technique is designed to:
- Create a physical "pattern interrupt"
- Ground you in your body
- Provide a concrete action when emotions feel abstract
- Serve as a mental "circuit breaker"

**Choosing the right technique:**
- **Public settings** - Snap, Tap, or Squeeze (discreet)
- **Private settings** - Any technique, especially Splash or Stomp
- **Immediate need** - Pinch, Snap, or Clap (quick)
- **Longer reset** - Stretch or Splash (takes more time)

### Intensity Tracking

Rate your feelings from 1-10:
- **1-3** - Mild, manageable discomfort
- **4-6** - Moderate, noticeably affecting you
- **7-9** - Severe, significantly impacting function
- **10** - Extreme, overwhelming

Track patterns over time to see if intensity decreases with regular resets.

### Notes Feature

Use notes to record:
- What triggered the feeling
- Where you were when it happened
- What worked or didn't work

- Progress you're noticing

## FAQ

### Is this app a replacement for therapy?

**No.** If Then Reset is a wellness tool designed to help you manage difficult moments. It is not a replacement for professional mental health care, therapy, diagnosis, or treatment. If you're struggling with mental health, please consult a licensed mental health professional.

### Does the app cost money?

## Tips for Success

### 1. Be Consistent
Try to use the app every time you notice a difficult feeling, even mild ones. Building the habit makes it more effective during intense moments.

### 2. Experiment with Techniques
Don't stick to just one reset technique. Try different methods to find what works best for different situations.

### 3. Review Your History
Look for patterns. Do certain feelings happen at certain times? Do specific techniques work better for specific feelings?

### 4. Add Detailed Notes
The more context you add in notes, the more useful your history becomes for identifying triggers and successful strategies.

### 5. Combine with Other Practices
Use If Then Reset alongside other wellness practices: therapy, exercise, sleep hygiene, healthy relationships, medication (if prescribed), etc.

### 6. Don't Judge Your Feelings
The app is judgment-free. There's no "good" or "bad" in tracking feelings. The goal is awareness and management, not perfection.

### 7. Share Your Progress
If you're working with a therapist, consider sharing your reset history with them. It can provide valuable insights into your patterns and progress.
