**On-Device Security:**

- Code is regularly reviewed for vulnerabilities
- We follow Apple's security best practices
- Regular app updates address any discovered issues

**Your Responsibility:**
- Use a strong device passcode/biometric lock
- Keep your iOS version updated

- Be cautious of device backups on shared computers

### No Data Breach Risk

Because we don't collect, transmit, or store any user data on our servers:
- There is no risk of a server-side data breach
- We cannot be hacked for user data (we don't have any)
- Your data is as secure as your device
