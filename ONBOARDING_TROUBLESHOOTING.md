## Welcome & Getting Started

### What is If/Then/Reset?

If/Then/Reset is a mental wellness app that helps you manage difficult emotions using a simple three-step process inspired by software debugging:

**IF** → Identify what you're feeling  
**THEN** → Breathe and prepare to reset  
**RESET** → Use a physical technique to reset your nervous system

Think of it as debugging your mind: identify the issue, apply the fix, and reboot the system.

### Who Should Use This App?

If/Then/Reset is designed for:
- ✓ Anyone experiencing anxiety, stress, or overwhelming emotions
- ✓ People seeking practical emotional regulation tools
- ✓ Individuals interested in mindfulness and self-care
- ✓ Those looking for quick, effective reset techniques
- ✓ Anyone wanting to track their emotional patterns

**Age Rating**: 12+ (mature themes related to mental health)

### What This App Is NOT

**Important**: If/Then/Reset is a wellness tool, NOT:
- ❌ Medical advice or treatment
- ❌ A substitute for therapy or counseling
- ❌ A diagnostic tool
- ❌ A crisis intervention service
- ❌ A replacement for professional mental health care

**Always consult qualified healthcare providers for medical concerns.**

## Understanding the App

### The IF/THEN/RESET Process

#### IF: Identify Your Feeling

**Purpose**: Acknowledge and name your emotion

**How It Works**:
1. Select from 8 emotion types:
   - Anxious
   - Depressed
   - Nervous
   - Overwhelmed
   - Stressed
   - Panicked
   - Sad
   - Worried

2. Rate intensity on a scale of 1-10:
   - 1-3: Mild
   - 4-6: Moderate
   - 7-9: Severe
   - 10: Extreme

**Why It Matters**:
- Naming emotions reduces their power
- Tracking intensity helps identify patterns
- Self-awareness is the first step to regulation

#### THEN: Breathe and Prepare

**Purpose**: Calm your nervous system and prepare for reset

**How It Works**:
1. Follow guided breathing exercise
2. Breathe in for 4 seconds
3. Hold for 4 seconds
4. Breathe out for 6 seconds
5. Repeat for 60 seconds

**Optional Enhancement** (Premium):
- Play ambient sounds during breathing
- Choose from 8 calming soundscapes
- Sounds continue in background

**Why It Matters**:
- Activates parasympathetic nervous system
- Slows heart rate
- Reduces cortisol (stress hormone)
- Prepares body for physical reset

#### RESET: Physical Technique

**Purpose**: Create a physical "circuit breaker" for anxious thoughts

**How It Works**:
1. Choose from 8 reset techniques:
   - **Pinch Myself**: Gently pinch your arm
   - **Snap Fingers**: Snap three times
   - **Tap Three Times**: Tap your temple
   - **Clap Hands**: Clap firmly
   - **Stretch Arms**: Stretch wide and breathe
   - **Splash Water**: Splash cold water on face
   - **Squeeze Hands**: Make fists, then release
   - **Stomp Feet**: Stomp firmly on ground

2. Follow on-screen instructions
3. Perform the technique mindfully
4. Notice the physical sensation

**Why It Matters**:
- Interrupts rumination and anxiety loops
- Grounds you in the present moment
- Provides sensory input to refocus attention
- Creates a "pattern interrupt" for your brain

### The Science Behind It

The IF/THEN/RESET process combines evidence-based techniques:

**Emotional Labeling** (IF):
- Research shows naming emotions reduces amygdala activity
- Increases prefrontal cortex engagement
- Improves emotional regulation

**Controlled Breathing** (THEN):
- Activates vagus nerve
- Shifts from sympathetic (fight/flight) to parasympathetic (rest/digest)
- Proven to reduce anxiety and stress

**Grounding Techniques** (RESET):
- Used in DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy)
- Interrupts dissociation and rumination
- Anchors attention in physical sensations
- Provides immediate distraction from intrusive thoughts
